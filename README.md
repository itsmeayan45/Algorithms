## 🛸 What's This Repo?

Welcome to **DAA-AlienForce** — a powerful repository of solved problems from **Design and Analysis of Algorithms**, coded with alien-level strategies.

Here, algorithms aren't just learned — they're **transformed**, just like Ben with his Omnitrix. Whether it's a greedy approach or dynamic programming, every section here is themed after one of Ben's iconic aliens.

## 🧬 Alien Force Breakdown

| 👽 Alien | 💡 Algorithm Type       | 🌌 Description |
|---------|------------------------|----------------|
| 🧠 Grey Matter | Greedy Algorithms     | Small size, big brain — chooses the best locally. |
| ⚡ XLR8       | Divide & Conquer     | Fast recursive breaks, faster merges. |
| 🕸️ Stinkfly  | Dynamic Programming | Efficient, airborne over repeated subproblems. |
| 💎 Diamondhead | Backtracking         | Shard-sharp solutions for constraint-heavy problems. |
| 🔥 Heatblast | Graph Algorithms     | Lighting up connections and paths in graphs. |
| 🤖 Upgrade   | Advanced Techniques  | High-tech strategies like Segment Trees & more. |
