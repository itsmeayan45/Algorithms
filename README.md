## 💥 What's This Repo?

Welcome to **DAA-AlienForce** — a personal repository of solved problems from **Design and Analysis of Algorithms**, coded with logic sharper than *Diamondhead's blades* and optimized for speed like *XLR8*. 🧠⚡

Each folder in this repo is themed like one of Ben's aliens, representing a unique algorithmic strategy!
