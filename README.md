## ðŸ“Œ About the Repository

This repository contains my curated solutions to problems from the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms** curriculum. These problems cover a wide range of algorithmic techniques and concepts, including:

- Divide and Conquer
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Branch and Bound
- Graph Algorithms
- NP-Completeness

Each problem is implemented with a focus on **efficiency**, **clarity**, and **scalability**.
